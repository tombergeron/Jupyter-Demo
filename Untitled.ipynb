    "\n",
    "Before describing how to get started using Jupyter Notebooks, I will assume that you have `pip` and `Python` (preferrably the latest version) installed. If this is not the case, please visit this https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/install-pip-for-python/ tutorial for instructions on how to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install Jupyter onto your computer, run the following commands in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "`python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "python3 -m pip install jupyter`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Depending on your version and Python path you created, `python3` may have to be switched to `python`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebooks can be run from the terminal or by using Anaconda. Please see: https://jupyter.org/install for more information.\n",

    "### Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks, as used in the context of scientific computing and numerical analysis, are a powerful tool to communicate mathematics and algorithms with code embedded. In this Jupyter notebook I will cover some of the basics to get you started using them. This tutorial is intended for a beginner with Jupyter notebooks and Python. \n",

    "To avoid 'hard-coding' make use of general functions and classes (if you know how). For instance, this can be done by creating one cell which contains most or all of your functions and algorithms that you wish to use. Commenting is advised and necessary, not only for someone reviewing your code, but also to keep track of your own thought process when devising an algorithm. Avoid `for` loops when possible as these will be computationally costly. Consider how loops can be supplemented in the 'Pythonic way' or using list slicing, as presented. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a powerful syntax for the logical operations. When combined with NumPy, one can perform basically everything you might need for numerical analysis. Creating efficient and concise implementations requires not only an understanding of the mathematics relevant to your problem but also practice writing code. \n",

    "Please email me at: seth.taylor@mail.mcgill.ca if you have any questions related to Python/NumPy or on getting set-up using Jupyter notebooks."
